Identifying issues during downtime is complicated, highly manual, and depends on the engineer/technician's work experience as well as the ability to draw quick insights from past historical data and multiple data sources and types (structured, unstructured data, time series data, etc.). Intel was looking for a GenAI powered solution to diagnose & resolve manufacturing problems & improve overall manufacturing process efficiency.",

    Challenge:
      "For BCG's consultants to deliver value in a timely manner to their clients, they were up against the significant challenge of making sense of an ever-growing digital repository accumulated over 50+ years dispersed across multiple data sources and involving multiple data formats. Every document was rich in text, graphs, and imagery and was hard to analyze quickly. Existing knowledge systems often forced consultants to use keyword-based searches, sometimes having to go page by page, and scanning entire documents from top to bottom. Consultants struggled to find the most relevant insights despite time-consuming search efforts.",

Traditional methods of financial data analysis are manual and time-consuming, and financial analysts spend hours on the company's platform searching and reading through all relevant documents to distill the data into actionable insights. In addition, they spend a considerable amount of time manually putting together reports that could sometimes be hundreds of pages long. They rely on tools offered by the Financial Analytics Company to inform and improve their investment thesis, however, the existing tools didn't offer rich connected inputs sourced from multi-modal datasets.
