        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">3. How We Use Your PII</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We may use the information we collect in the following ways:
        </p>

        <div className="ml-6">
          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">a. General and Marketing Communications</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We may use your PII to send you communications (possibly including via email, text message, phone, or U.S. mail) that explain our solutions and their features and to encourage use of our Services. In addition, we may send you marketing communications (so-read as a supplement to the Services). If you send you a marketing communication through the Services, it will include instructions on how to opt out of receiving these communications in the future (for more information about opting out, see Section 6 below).
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">b. Combined Information</h4>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">c. Specific Communications</h4>

            We will use your PII to send you billing communications in regard to the status of your account.

Further, we may use your PII to respond to your submissions, questions, comments, requests and complaints, and to provide you with customer service.

          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">d. Analytics</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We may use your PII to facilitate our internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, customization, and enhancements to the Services. As part of these efforts, we strip PII of its sensitive and individual data and make it anonymous so that it no longer PII ("non-PII"), and then we aggregate non-PII with other non-PII data can tell us how often users access a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services more efficient, and to make them as useful to as many users as possible. We also use anonymous non-PII, some of which is obtained via pixels or web beacons, for internal research and development purposes to improve our products, and to improve and test the features and functions of our Services.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">e. Administrative Communications</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We may use your PII to send you confirmations, updates, security alerts, and administrative notifications about the status of our Services or about your account.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">f. Legal Enforcement</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We may use your PII to protect our users and to protect or enforce our rights, or through a legal right.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">h. Retention</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We may retain your PII as long as you are registered to use the Services. As discussed below, if you close your account and delete your account profile, we will delete your securely held PII within thirty (30) days.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">f. Enforcing Legal Rights</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We may need to disclose your PII to protect the rights of our users or to protect our property.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">g. Complying with Legal Orders</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We may be required to use and retain PII for legal and compliance reasons, such as the prevention, detection, or investigation of a crime; loss prevention; or fraud. We may also use PII to meet our internal and external audit requirements, information security purposes, and as we otherwise believe to be necessary or appropriate: (1) to enforce our terms and conditions; (2) to protect our operations; (3) to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, or those of other persons; (4) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit damages; and (5) to respond to emergencies. For these purposes, we reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary for us to comply with law or with an order from a regulatory agency, to enforce our agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our employees, our Users, or others.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">4. The Limited Ways in which we Share PII with Third Parties</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Articul8 will never sell or rent your PII. However, Articul8 may share PII with a third party in the following ways:
        </p>

        <div className="ml-6">
          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">a. Consented Use</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If we obtain your consent, such as when you choose to opt-in to the sharing of data, we may share your PII in order to provide the Services to you. Similarly, we need to disclose some of your PII in order to fulfill a request from you.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">b. Contracts with Partners and Service Providers</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We may enter into contracts with other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf, and we may need to share your PII with them to provide products or services to you. These vendors do not have any right to use the PII we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us, and their agreements with us bind them to confidentiality obligations in regard to your PII.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">c. Marketing</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We may engage with a service provider for marketing and promotional purposes, and effective marketing may require us to provide some PII to the marketing service provider.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">d. Asset Purchases or Sales</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We may choose to buy or sell business assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred (if we or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control. Also, if we are acquired by or merged with a third party. In any transaction of this sort, strict confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements would bind the parties to an obligation to preserve the confidentiality of your PII.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">e. Aggregate Non-PII</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We may provide anonymized non-PII information in aggregate form to our partners and service providers, who may perform various analytics on our Services or may use the aggregated information to develop their own marketing for their own business purposes. In such circumstances, we never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">f. Legal Enforcement</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We may need to disclose your PII to protect the rights of our users or to protect Articul8's rights or property.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">g. Complying with Legal Orders</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We may be required to use and retain PII for legal and compliance reasons, such as the prevention, detection, or investigation of a crime; loss prevention; or fraud. We may also use PII to meet our internal and external audit requirements, information security purposes, and as we otherwise believe to be necessary or appropriate: (1) to enforce our terms and conditions; (2) to protect our operations; (3) to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, or those of other persons; (4) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit damages; and (5) to respond to emergencies.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Your Rights to Control Your Use of Your PII</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You have the right to control the use of your PII in the ways enumerated below.

        <div className="ml-6">

            You have the right to request that we delete any PII we have collected from you.

          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">e. The Right to Say No</h4>

Clicking on that choice will bring you here to this Policy, where we provide the email address and toll free number above to allow you to communicate to us your desire to opt out.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">g. The Right to Not Be Tracked</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            You have the right not to be tracked for targeted advertising. Your right to opt-out of such tracking is protected under CalOPPA. In most web browsers (including but not limited to, Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer, or Firefox) you can set the "Do Not Track" (or DNT) preference setting in your browser to opt-out of online behavioral tracking. We respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals, as we are required to do under CalOPPA.

If we learn that we have collected PII from a child under age 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible as may be required by COPPA and other laws. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information without parental consent, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@articul8.ai" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">privacy@articul8.ai</a> or call us at contact support at <a href="mailto:support@articul8.ai" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">support@articul8.ai</a>.
